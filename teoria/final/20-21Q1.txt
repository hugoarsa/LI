4) (3 points) For 4a and 4b, just write the simplest and cleanest possible formula F . Use no more
predicate or function symbols than just p. Give no explanations.

4a) Write a satisfiable first-order formula F , using only a binary predicate p, such that all models I of F have an infinite domain DI .


Ax -p(x,x) & AxAyAz ((p(x,y) & p(y,z)) -> p(x,z))  & AxEy p(x,y)


4b) Write a satisfiable formula F of first-order logic with equality, using only a unary predicate p, such that F expresses that there is a single element satisfying p, that is, all models I of F have a single (unique) element e in its domain DI such that pI (e) = 1.

Ex (p(x) & Ay (y!=x -> -p(y)))




5) (3 points) Let F be the first-order formula ∃x∀y∃z ( p(z, y) ∧ ¬p(x, y) ).
5a) Give a model I of F with DI = {a, b, c}.

suponemos que x existe y es una a, entonces p(a,y) ha de ser falso para todo y

y despues para todo y cuando lo mezclamos con z que seria o bien b o c deberia ser cierto


5b) Is it true that F |= ∀x p(x, x)?


La verdad es que no, al menos por como definimos el modelo anterior


5c) Is there any model of F with a single-element domain?

no, al menos dos




6) (4 points) Formalize and prove by resolution that sentence F is a logical consequence of the first
five:


A: All people that have electric cars are ecologists.
B: If someone has a grandmother, then that someone has a mother whose mother is that grandmother.
C: A person is an ecologist if his/her mother is an ecologist.
D: Mary is John’s grandmother.
E: Mary has an electric car.
F: John is an ecologist.

To find if the F sentence is a logical consequence i have to find if A & B & C & D & E & -F is unsat

To modelate I will use the following definitions:

hasElectric(x)
isEcologist(x)
hasGranny(x,y)
hasMama(x,y)

B: AxAy (Grany(x,y) -> Ez (Mama(x,z) & Mama(z,y))

used:

E: hasElectric(mary)

A: -hasElectric(x) v isEcologist(x)

unused:

B1: -Grany(x,y) v Mama(x,f(x,y))
B2: -Grany(x,y) v Mama(f(x,y),y)

C: -mama(x,y) v -isEcologist(y) v isEcologist(x))

D: granny(john,mary)

-F: -isEcologsit(jonh)


A with E -> 
1: isEcologist(mary)

B1 with D and B2 with D ->
2: Mama(jonh,f(jonh,mary))
3: Mama(f(jonh,mary),mary)

C with 2 and C with 3 -> 
4: -isEcologist(f(jonh,mary)) v isEcologist(jonh)
5: -isEcologist(mary) v isEcologist(f(jonh,mary))

1 with 5 ->

6: isEcologist(f(jonh,mary))

6 with 4 ->

7: isEcologist(jonh)

7 with -F ->

8: []

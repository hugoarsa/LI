Problem 1. (3 points).                                     @n@nota1:

1a) Given two propositional formulas F and G, is it true that F -> G is tautology and
    F satisfiable, then G is satisfiable?
    Prove it using only the formal definitions of propositional logic.

F -> G is tautology  			ssi [def. tautology]
A I, I is model of F -> G 	 	ssi [def. model]
A I, I |= F -> G		 	ssi [def. |=]
A I, evalI(F -> G) = 1		 	ssi [def. ->]
A I, evalI(-F v G) = 1		 	ssi [def. v]
A I, max(evalI(-F),evalI(G)) = 1 	ssi [def. -]
A I, max(1-evalI(F),evalI(G)) = 1 	ssi [add both on the *]

F is satisfactible			ssi [def. sat]
E I, I is model of F			ssi [def. model]
E I, I |= F				ssi [def. |=]
E I, evalI(F) = 1			ssi [add both on the *]

E I, evalI(F) = 1 and max(1-evalI(F),evalI(G)) = 1 ssi [arithmetic transformations]
E I, max(1 - 1, evalI(G)) = 1 		ssi [max properties]
E I, evalI(G) = 1			ssi [def. |= and model]
E I, I is model of G			ssi [def. SAT]
G is sat

1b) Give an example of formulas F1, F2, and F3 such that F1 & F2 & F3 is unsatisfiable
    and any conjuction of two of then is satisfiable.

    For example, consider P={p,q} and the formulas:
      F1 = -p v q
      F2 = p
      F3 = -q
    The interpretation I(p)=1 I(q)=1 satisfies  F1 & F2
    The interpretation I(p)=0 I(q)=0 satisfies  F1 & F3
    The interpretation I(p)=1 I(q)=0 satisfies  F2 & F3
    But F1 & F2 & F3 is unsatisfiable

Problem 2. (2.5 points).                                   @n@nota2:


We define the problem NEG-SAT as follows:
given a propositional formula F, to determine whether there exists I such that I |= -F.

a) Describe a linear-time algorithm for NEG-SAT when the input formula
   is in CNF. Justify its correctness and its cost.

   Hint: you can assume that, given a clause C, detecting if
         C contains contradictory literals, i.e., p and -p for
         some variable p, can be done in linear time.

This algorithm would basically turn the CNF formula into a DNF (because of demorgan)
so there would be a lineal time algorithm that could be used in order to determine SAT.

The algoritm goes as it follows:
Since all the clauses are connected with "v" as long as we find a single sat clause we 
have a sat formula (because if C is sat C v F is sat too!)

Proof:
DNF sat <-> Ci clause is sat <-> No contradictory literals in Ci 

Time: 
linear transformation with demorgan, linear search of contradictory literals -> O(n)

solution given by the teachers: it's the same but they use an algorythm for demonstrating
tautology of F (which implies that -F is insat), basically the negated version of my algorithm

    The algorithm works as follows. Let F be the input CNF. If F is the
    empty set of clauses, then F is a tautology, and hence we return NO.
    Otherwise we take a clause C of F. If there is a pair of contradictory
    literals in C, then C is a tautology that can be discarded, and the
    algorithm starts again with the resulting formula. Otherwise we can build
    an interpretation I that falsifies C by setting to false all the literals
    in C. This interpretation also falsifies F, and so we return YES.

    The algorithm is correct because when we return YES, we have indeed
    found an interpretation that falsifies F. For the reverse implication,
    if there exists I such that I |= -F, then there exists C âˆˆ F such that
    I |= -C. The algorithm will return YES when this clause is processed.

    Since detecting contradictory literals can be done in linear time and
    we just need to make one pass over the formula, the algorithm is linear.

The algorithm goes as it follows:
For every clause we check for contradictory literals with lineal time

b) Let us call CNF-NEG-SAT the linear-time algorithm of the previous
   exercise for NEG-SAT when the input formula is in CNF:

     Algorithm CNF-NEG-SAT
     ---------------------

     Input: propositional formula F in CNF

     Output:
       YES if there exists I such that I |= -F,
       NO otherwise


   Consider now the following algorithm for solving the SAT problem for
   arbitrary formulas:

     Algorithm MY-SAT
     ----------------

     Input: propositional formula F

     Output:
       YES if there exists I such that I |= F,
       NO otherwise

     Step 1. G := Tseitin_transformation_of(-F)
     Step 2. return CNF-NEG-SAT(G)

   The algorithm MY-SAT is NOT correct. Prove it giving a counterexample.

solution from teachers:

    (could have got it but got caught following useless leads)
    First of all notice that the Tseitin transformation G of any formula
    is of the form p & G', where G' is some CNF and p is the auxiliary
    propositional variable representing the root of the formula tree. So
    for any interpretation I such that I(p) = 0 we will have not(I |= G),
    i.e., I |= -G. So in algorithm MY-SAT(F), the call CNF-NEG-SAT(G)
    always returns YES, independently of F. In particular, even if F is
    unsatisfiable (for example, q & -q), MY-SAT(F) will return YES.

Problem 3. (2.5 points).                                   @n@nota3:

3) Given S a set of clauses (CNF) over n propositional symbols,
   and Resolution the deductive rule:
   
                 p v C          -p v D
		 ---------------------      for some symbol p
		         C v D

3a) Given n propositional symbols, how many different clauses are there (seen as sets of literals)?

4^n

3c) Is Resolution a correct deductive rule:  (p v C) & (-p v D) |= C v D  for any p, C, D?
    Prove it.

we could study this with cases:

eval(p) = 0 then I |= (p v C) & (-p v D) -> I |= -p v D -> I |= D -> I |= C v D

eval(p) = 1 then I |= (p v C) & (-p v D) -> I |= p v C -> I |= C -> I |= C v D

3c) Can Resolution be used to decide SAT? Briefly explain why o why not?

Yes because there's a refutational completeness with resolution that makes it so
S is insat <-> [] belongs to Res(S), we could use the contrareciproco to do the same

And since the closure under resolution of an initial set S, Res(S) can be computed in a 
finite number of steps we are safe

Problem 4. (2 points).                                     @n@nota4: 

4) Consider the cardinality constraint x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 >= 2 (expressing that at
   least 2 of the propositional symbols {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5} are true).

4a) Write the clauses needed to encode this constraint using no auxiliary variables.

...


4b) In general, in terms of n and k, how many clauses are needed to encode a cardinality
    constraint x1 + . . . + xn >= k using no auxiliary variables? (give no explanations here).

...


4c) Write at least two names of any other encoding you know for cardinality constraints,
    encodings that do use auxiliary variables.
